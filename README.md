<p align="center">An ambitious attempt to recreate Pokémon as a text-based adventure in Java. Dive into the nostalgic world of Pokémon battles, exploration, and collection, all through the charm of text.</p>

<h2>🔍 Overview</h2>
<ul>
  <li><code>Battle.java</code>: Contains the core logic for battles (incomplete).</li>
  <li><code>theMain.java</code>: The main game loop leading up to the first battle with the rival (partially complete).</li>
  <li>Data Files: Include Pokémon names, base stats, item names, etc.</li>
</ul>

### Current Progress

- `Battle.java`: Under construction. The core mechanics of Pokémon battles are being implemented here.
- `theMain.java`: This is the heart of the game, orchestrating the loading of data files, initiating battles, and progressing the storyline. Currently, it extends up to the first battle between the main character and their rival.
