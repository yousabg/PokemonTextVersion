# PokemonTextVersion
An attempt to recreate Pokemon but as a text version in Java.
All text files are datasets of things that were needed (Pokemon names, base stats, item names, etc.)
The Battle.java code is not complete. This is where I had to stop.
theMain.java is also not complete, it currently extends all the way to the first battle between the main character and his rival.
theMain.java is the main code that will run everything. Load all these files in a src folder for any Java compiler and the code should function correctly.
